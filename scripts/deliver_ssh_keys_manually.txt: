# Delivering SSH Keys Manually

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have SSH access to the Raspberry Pi devices.
2. Have your SSH public key ready (e.g., id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa.pub).

## Steps

### 1. Locate Your SSH Public Key
The default location is:
- id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa.pub
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


### 2. Copy the SSH Key to the Raspberry Pi
Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy your SSH key to each Raspberry Pi device.

#### Command Syntax
```sh
ssh-copy-id -i <path_to_your_public_key> <username>@<raspberry_pi_ip>

3. Example Commands
For Raspberry Pi 1:

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub elbit@192.168.0.100

4. Verify SSH Access
After copying the SSH key, verify that you can SSH into each Raspberry Pi without a password.
ssh <username>@<raspberry_pi_ip>

Troubleshooting
If you are prompted for a password, ensure that the SSH key was copied correctly.
Check the permissions of the ~/.ssh directory and the authorized_keys file on the Raspberry Pi.

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
